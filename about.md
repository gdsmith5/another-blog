This blog was born out of several years of teaching a graduate course, Chemometrics. In it, I teach students how to use statistics and Machine Learning tools in MATLAB to solve Chemistry problems.

Along the way, I've found that students

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### My story

I'm a professor of Chemistry at the University of Georgia. My research lab builds instruments to measure how aerosol particles in the atmosphere interact with sunlight [SmithLab group website](http://www.smithlab.uga.edu){:target="_blank"}.

I teach undergraduate Thermodynamics and Statistical Thermodynamics (CHEM 3212), graduate Chemometrics - Machine Learning for Chemistry (CHEM 8860) and a First-Year Odyssey course on baseball statistics (yes, freshman can take a 1-credit class in which they learn about advanced baseball stats!).
